    "\n",
    "If your scripts contains multiple files (different modules or something), it is not easy to do. As you can only add your\n",
    "\"utility\" scripts as separate kernels, and refer to that kernel if you want to use. An workaround way is that you upload your code to github, and in your kernel code, you download the github codes and run them.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pros\n",
    "- If you need to do submission **automation**, the API will help a lot. \n",
    "- If your network is unstable, this API can help too, so you won't suffer from disconnection from the web kernel.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Cons\n",
    "If you need to do interactive things (like debugging), you still need to use the webpage."
